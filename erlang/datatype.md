Erlang is a programming language known for its support of functional programming and concurrency. In Erlang, like in many other programming languages, you can work with various data types. Here are some of the common data types in Erlang:

Atoms: Atoms are constants where their name is their own value. For example: ok, true, false.

Integers: Erlang supports both fixed-precision integers (e.g., 42) and arbitrary-precision integers (e.g., 123456789012345678901234567890).

Floating-Point Numbers: These are represented as double-precision floating-point numbers, like 3.14159.

Tuples: Tuples are ordered collections of elements. They are defined with curly braces, for example: {1, "apple"}.

Lists: Lists are ordered collections that can hold elements of different data types. They are defined with square brackets, for example: [1, 2, 3].

Binary: Binaries are sequences of bytes. They are often used to work with binary data like files.

Strings: Erlang represents strings as lists of integers, where each integer corresponds to the Unicode code point of a character.

Records: Records are user-defined data structures with named fields. They are often used to represent complex data.

Maps: Maps are key-value data structures introduced in newer versions of Erlang. They allow you to associate keys with values.

PIDs (Process Identifiers): In Erlang, processes are a fundamental unit of concurrency, and each process is identified by a unique PID.

References: References are unique identifiers used for various purposes, like message passing and distributed computing.

Functions: Functions are first-class citizens in Erlang, and you can assign them to variables and pass them as arguments.

Modules: In Erlang, modules are used to organize code and define functions.

These are some of the fundamental data types in Erlang. Erlang's lightweight processes, message-passing concurrency model, and fault-tolerant features make it well-suited for building highly concurrent and distributed systems.
